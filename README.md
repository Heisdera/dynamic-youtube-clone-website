3. DOM Manipulation
4. Functions
5. Conditional statements and template literals
6. EventListeners

## Summary

After long thought of what personal project i should build to practice my javascript skills aside from the javascript course projects i decided to start with this because it would be nice to move from being just static to being Dynamic and it holds cool real world features.

It may not be the best approach used but I'm happy with this i had fun refactoring the html & css codes and gave it life by adding some javascriptüòÅ.

### Project Duration - 3 days (Aug 24th - Aug 26th / 2023)
